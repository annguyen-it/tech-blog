              I signed up to DEV with GitHub/Twitter, but can't figure out how to disconnect or switch out this OAuth method from my account. Can you help me?
                </Text><Text
                fontSize='xl'>
               The problem you're running into is because you must have one OAuth method always connected to your DEV account.

The easiest way to go about solving this issue is to add another OAuth method to your DEV account. There are a couple of ways you can approach thisâ€¦

Firstly, you can add a Forem account to your DEV account by creating one here and then connecting it to your account via your settings. Once youâ€™ve done so, you can then disconnect your GitHub/Twitter account from your DEV profile and add your desired account.

Just scroll down underneath the "Danger Zone" and click "Remove GitHub" or "Remove Twitter" (whichever is applicable). After refreshing the page, you'll see the option to add the new account.

If youâ€™d rather not create a Forem account, you can use the same process above but connect a GitHub/Twitter account to your DEV account instead prior to removing the GitHub/Twitter account you'd like to remove.

Alternatively, if you'd rather not connect a GitHub/Twitter account to your DEV account. You can create a new DEV account with your desired OAuth method and email us at yo@dev.to requesting that we merge your two accounts together. If this is the case, be prepared to prove ownership over both of your accounts.

                </Text><Text
                fontSize='xl'>
               As part of our spam prevention defense, we do not currently offer folks the option to sign up via email.

Right now we only offer the option to sign up using OAuth. We offer traditional OAuth methods like Twitter, Apple, and GitHub, but also offer sign up via our own OAuth method called Forem Passport which you can learn about here. In short, Forem passport will allow you to easily sign up with any Forem community like DEV, CodeNewbie, or others.
